title: "Haunted TV"
summary: "I've used a Raspberry Pi, camera, and OpenCV to create a creepy camera feed on an old B&W TV which is triggered by face/eye detection. When the Raspberry Pi detects a face, it turns on the TV displaying a live camera feed. When the face looks away from the TV a ghost is displayed in the background(using background subtraction). Once the face looks back at the TV, sees the ghost and turns behind a second time, the ghost disappears and, after a few seconds the TV turns off, restarting the cycle."
