title: "One Button Game Console"
summary: "OTES (One-Thumb Entertainment System) is a Raspberry Pi powered, retro-inspired portable CRT Game Console which has only one button. It's running PICO-8, a fantasy console. And It's based on a stand-alone cartridge firmware meaning that it will boot directly to the game on the SD card like a GameBoy. So SD cards can be used as cartridges."
