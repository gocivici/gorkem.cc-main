title: "Quantum Death Machine"
summary: "The Quantum Death Machine is powered by a raspberry pi, a thermal printer, and a fingerprint scanner. When someone puts their finger on the scanner, instructions of a quantum circuit(a quantum dice) are sent to an actual quantum computer by IBM. A prompt from a DeathList is then selected based on the quantum dice result and gets printed on thermal paper."
